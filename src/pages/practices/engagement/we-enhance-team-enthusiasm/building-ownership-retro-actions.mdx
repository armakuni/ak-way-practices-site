# Building ownership retro actions

To ensure action items from agile retrospectives are completed,Â focus on:

**Clear action items:** Define goals, assign responsibility, and set deadlines.

**Team involvement:** Encourage collaboration and shared responsibility.

**Visualisation:** Use boards to track progress and celebrate achievements.

**Regular review:** Schedule check-ins and share updates.

**Recognition:** Acknowledge and appreciate team members' efforts.

**Leadership support:** Demonstrate commitment and provide resources.

**Empowerment:** Grant decision-making authority and support team growth.

By implementing these strategies, you can foster a culture of ownership and accountability within your agile team.
