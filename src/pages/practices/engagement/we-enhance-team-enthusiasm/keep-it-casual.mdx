# Keep it Casual

Tips for a good demo without the formalities.

**Collaborative Tone:** Emphasize learning and create a safe space for sharing progress, not perfection.

**Casual Atmosphere:** Use informal language, humour, and celebrate small wins to keep things light.

**Reduce Spotlight:** Pair team members for demos and rotate responsibilities to ease individual pressure.

**Conversational Demos:** Encourage interactive discussions and questions during demos for a more natural flow.

**Short and Focused:** Keep demos brief and avoid formal slides, focusing on showing work in progress.

**Positive Reinforcement:** Promote peer feedback and constructive, low-stakes critique to support team confidence.
