# Making work visible

Getting Started with Visualizing Work:

- **Choose a visualization tool:** This could be a physical board, a digital tool like Trello, Jira, or a simple whiteboard.
- **Define your workflow:** Map out the stages of your work, from backlog to done.
- **Create columns:** Set up columns on your board to represent each stage of your workflow (e.g., Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Add cards:** Represent each work item (user story, task) as a card.
- **Start filling the board:** Add cards to the appropriate columns based on their current status.
- **Regular updates:** Keep the board up-to-date by moving cards as work progresses.
