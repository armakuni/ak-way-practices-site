# NPS

How to Calculate NPS:

1. **Survey Customers:** Ask them to rate their likelihood of recommending your product/service on a scale from 0 to 10.
2. **Categorize Responses:**
   - **Promoters (9-10)**:
     Loyal customers.
   - **Passives (7-8):**
     Satisfied but not enthusiastic.
   - **Detractors (0-6):**
     Unhappy customers.
3. **Calculate Percentages:**
   - **% Promoters:**
     (Promoters / Total Responses) x 100
   - **% Detractors:**
     (Detractors / Total Responses) x 100
4. **Calculate NPS:**
   Subtract % Detractors from % Promoters:
   NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors
5. **Interpret:** Positive NPS indicates more promoters than detractors; above 50 is excellent.
