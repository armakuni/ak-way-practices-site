# Delivering A Talk

This page will give you a breakdown of how to prepare for public speaking. This
guide is aimed for talks of more than 8 people, so for talks smaller than that
you might not find this that useful. This guide will give you an overview to
creating the talk, practicing, and managing the stress.

## Creating An Abstract

The first thing you'll find yourself doing when creating a talk is writing an
abstract. An abstract is a paragraph on your talk and a second paragraph on who
is giving it. It should give people enough information to decide if they want to
see the talk or not.

The abstract is used for multiple things. You will find it:

* Included on the website of the place you're giving the talk
* Emailed to attendants
* Included in videos of the talk
* Printed on conference programs
* Included on "Speaker" pages
* Used to decide which talks to include at a conference

To make it useful in all those different places one formula you can use is:

> Hook. Through line. Expected Outcome.
>
> Speaker Bio.

Here's an example of that model from [Denise Yu at DevOps days London 2018](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-london/program/denise-yu/)

> Distributed systems are known for being notoriously difficult to wrangle. But why? This talk will cover a brief history of distributed databases, clear up some common myths about the CAP theorem, dig into why network partitions are inevitable, and close out by highlighting how a few popular open source projects manage the uncertainty created during a partition event. Almost all slides will contain original illustration featuring mischievous cats masquerading as sysadmins. By the end of this talk you will have a better understanding about the design trade-offs involved in architecting for distributed systems, and hopefully be inspired to pick up sketchnoting!

Denise has previously delivered conference talks on topics ranging from continuous delivery to functional programming to scaling company culture. She enjoys learning about distributed systems, release engineering, and low-level Linux kernel programming.

Lets break that down:

### The Hook

> Distributed systems are known for being notoriously difficult to wrangle. But why?

The hook is a statement that is designed to be eye catching and lure someone who
is skimming maybe 10 or 20 talks to keep reading a bit more about yours. I tend
to write these last in my abstract.

### The Through Line

> This talk will cover a brief history of distributed databases, clear up some common myths about the CAP theorem, dig into why network partitions are inevitable, and close out by highlighting how a few popular open source projects manage the uncertainty created during a partition event. Almost all slides will contain original illustration featuring mischievous cats masquerading as sysadmins.

The through line, sometimes it's called the spine, is a term that comes from acting which means a series of objectives that should be passed through to reach the expected outcome. This is usually the first part of the abstract I develop.

A good way to do this is to first think about what you want to talk about in the general. Next think about who your audience will be. For example in this case it's for DevOps days which is a mixture of people with lots of ops experience and for people who analyze complex systems using Lean and Theory of Constraints. Your though line should have something attractive in there for each member of your target audience.

There's a few good sources for who your audience will be. If you're speaking at a meet-up, have a look through their previous talks and see who spoke and on what, you can also just ask the organizer.

```admonish tip
An excellent way to get a deeper insight into your audience is [Empathy Mapping](../lean-agile/empathy-mapping.md)
```

Once you have a number of things that you want to talk about, tie them together with a narrative or series of increasingly complicated examples. This is your through line.

### Expected Outcome

> By the end of this talk you will have a better understanding about the design trade-offs involved in architecting for distributed systems, and hopefully be inspired to pick up sketchnoting!

After you have developed your through line write what, at the end of your talk they'll be doing differently when they leave your talk as to when they walked in through the door.

### The Speaker Bio

Denise has previously delivered conference talks on topics ranging from continuous delivery to functional programming to scaling company culture. She enjoys learning about distributed systems, release engineering, and low-level Linux kernel programming.

The speaker is usually something a bit free form that you can write about yourself. Usually it backs up your credibility to speak on what you're talking about in your talk, so you might mention how long you've used what you're talking about.

These differ pretty widely, but usually cover who you are, what you do day to day, something about your experience.

## Developing the Talk

This is different for each person, however this general framework works well

### Early Stage

The first thing you should do is using as lightweight at technique as possible
try and put together a series of slides. You're trying to get a story that works together and start identifying areas that need more details.

You can do this by:

* By writing a title for the slide on a post-it note
* Creating a text file with the slide titles
* With some lightweight slide creation tool to make slides with one word on them

Once this is done, try reading them out loud and working out your narrative flow. This is also an opportunity to make sure you have content for each of your audience members.

### Enriching

After a while you'll have discovered where you need to add additional content in your slide decks.

Now is the time to translate your slides into whatever presentation tool you're going to use for the real thing: Keynote, Powerpoint, Google Slides are all common choices. Start fleshing out the slides with examples, diagrams, demos and animations.

Once the initial deck is done for this, I like to do an early version in front of someone I trust. With the feedback from this I make another version that I do in front of a couple more people, and so on until I have done the talk in front of 7 or 8 people.

This is less to improve the slides than to make the talk sound natural when it's being presented.

### Local Run

This step is optional if your talk is only at a local meet-up, but it's invaluable when preparing for a conference.

Find a local meet up that matches your expected audience for the talk. Send them your abstract, and hopefully they will accept you as a speaker, and you can give the talk there. This will help you know what it's going to be like to give the talk for a bigger audience and should help you iron out problems with mixed skillset audiences.

Depending on how confident you're feeling you could promote your talk on social media.


### The Big Day

If you've followed this model then you'll probably be ready right now: You can do this!

Remember to schedule social media running up to the event to get people to know about your talk. This should be done sparingly when it's a long way out, but more frequently towards the big day.

Have a copy of your slides ready to upload to [slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/) or some other slide hosting service so you can share that on social media after your talk.

Hang around afterwards and chat with other attendees and speakers. Part of why we do talks is to make new connections and if you disappear off right away you miss out on that opportunity.

Let me say that again: You can do this!

## Managing Stress

If it's your first or 500th time speaking you're going to be nervous. Over 75% of people experience anxiety when public speaking, the other 25% are liars. The best way to combat it will vary from person to person but here are a few suggestions:

* Practice in front of people often
* Spend 5 min deep breathing
* Have something other to do than wait for your talk's slot
* Spend 5 min thinking about what you're experiencing with your senses right now
* Think about how excited you are to give the talk, and how it's going to be great

There are many other methods for this but these are the ones that work for me.

## Conclusion

If you've got to this point you have some good ideas about how to create a talk. Your methods may vary from these slightly, and that's ok, speaking is a creative process and everyone is different. Hopefully even if you've done lots of these you'll have some nice new ideas on how to give a talk.
