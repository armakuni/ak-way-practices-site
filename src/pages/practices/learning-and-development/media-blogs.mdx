# Armakuni Recommended Reading

This list details Ak's recommended reading.

- Firstly, the "Ak way" reads - all materials explicitly relating to how Ak works
- Secondly, general reads - a collection of recommended reading from the team around wider or more detailed topics!
- Finally, Ak mantains a blog, where all members are able to contribute. These often highlight our ways of working as well as spotlighting what it is like to to work at Armakuni. You can check this out at [CloudNative.ly](https://cloudnative.ly/)
