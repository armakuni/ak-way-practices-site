# Simulated game days

Have fun with a simulated game day.

1. **Define Objectives and Plan Scenarios:** Set clear goals and develop realistic failure scenarios to test system resilience and team response.
2. **Prepare and Communicate:** Inform the team about the game day, their roles, and ensure all necessary tools and monitoring systems are in place.
3. **Execute Scenarios:** Introduce the planned failures into the environment, either manually or using automation tools.
4. **Monitor and Document:** Observe system behaviour and team responses, documenting everything for analysis.
5. **Conduct Post-Mortem and Improve:** Review the outcomes, identify weaknesses, and implement necessary improvements. Schedule regular game days for ongoing enhancement.
