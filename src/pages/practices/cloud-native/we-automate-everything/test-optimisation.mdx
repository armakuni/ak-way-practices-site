# Test optimization

Strategies you can use:

- **Run Tests in Parallel:**
  Use tools to execute tests simultaneously.
- **Optimize Test Suite:**
  Remove redundant tests and focus on high-value tests.
- **Use Mocks and Stubs:**
  Isolate components to avoid slow dependencies.
- **Implement Incremental Testing:**
  Only test changes, not the entire suite.
- **Efficient Test Data Management:**
  Use lightweight, in-memory databases or fixtures.
