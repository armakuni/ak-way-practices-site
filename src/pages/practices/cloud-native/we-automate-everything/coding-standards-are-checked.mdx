# Infrastructure as Code

How to get started!

**Start with Non-Critical Infrastructure:** Select non-essential parts of your system to minimize impact. Choose an open-source IaC tool.

**Implement IaC:** Make all infrastructure changes through code, committing to the repository, and avoid manual changes.

**Automate with CI/CD:** Create pipelines to automate provisioning and updates, including automated tests to validate changes before deployment.

**Parameterize and Modularize:** Create reusable modules and use variables/configuration files to customize settings for different environments.
