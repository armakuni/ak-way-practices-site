# Distributed Tracing

Let's get started!

1. **Select and Integrate a Tool:**
   Add tracing instrumentation to your code and propagate trace context across services.
2. **Deploy and Configure Infrastructure:**
   Set up trace collectors and a storage backend. Configure sampling rates and ensure trace data is reported timely.
3. **Visualize and Monitor:**
   Create dashboards to visualize traces and service maps, and set up alerts for anomalies or errors in traces.
