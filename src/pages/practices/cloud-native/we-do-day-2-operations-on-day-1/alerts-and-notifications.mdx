# Alerts and Notifications

How to begin crafting impactful alerts and notifications

1. **Focus on Actionable Events:** Don't just inform, empower! Alerts should signal issues requiring a response, not simply report every minor blip.
2. **Prioritize Clarity:** Keep it concise and clear. The notification should instantly tell the recipient what's wrong and what (if anything) they need to do.
3. **Target the Right Audience:** Don't bombard everyone. Tailor alerts to the specific people who can address the situation.
4. **Less is More:** Avoid overwhelming users with a constant barrage of alerts. Prioritize critical information and send notifications sparingly.
5. **Consider Tone and Timing:** Be mindful of the context. A security breach requires a serious tone, while a game update might be more playful.
