# Blue/Green Deployments

Here's the gist.

- Maintain two identical environments
  (blue: running version, green: new version).

- Deploy and thoroughly test the new version in the green environment.

- Switch traffic from blue to green using a load balancer (all at once or gradually).

  - All at once (cutover) is faster but riskier.
  - Gradual rollout (canary deployment) minimizes risk but takes longer.

- Closely monitor the green environment after switching traffic.

- Roll back to blue if critical issues occur.
