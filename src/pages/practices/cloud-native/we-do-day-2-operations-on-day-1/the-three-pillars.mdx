# The 3 Pillars

1. **Logs tell the story.**
   They provide rich context about specific events, including errors, warnings, and successful actions. This detail allows you to pinpoint the "what" and "when" of an issue.
1. **Metrics show the vitals.**
   Metrics offer a real-time overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) like CPU usage, memory consumption, or response times. They help you understand the "how well" a system is performing and identify potential bottlenecks.
1. **Traces map the journey.**
   Traces track the individual journey of a request as it travels through different parts of a system. This helps you pinpoint the exact location of an issue and understand the "why" behind performance problems.
