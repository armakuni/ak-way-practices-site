# SLAs and SLOs

For Service Level Agreements (SLAs):

- **Focus on Customer Needs:** Craft your SLAs around what truly matters to your customers. Don't get bogged down in technical details; focus on the user experience.

For Service Level Objectives (SLOs):

- **Set Measurable Objectives:** Ensure your SLOs are clearly defined and can be quantified with specific metrics. This allows for clear measurement and tracking.
- **Prioritize Wisely:** Don't overwhelm yourself with too many SLOs. Choose a few key metrics that truly reflect the most critical aspects of your service.
- **Leave Room for Improvement:** Aim to set SLOs that are a bit more stringent than your SLAs. This creates a buffer zone and allows your team to innovate while still meeting customer expectations.
