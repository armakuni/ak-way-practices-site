# Chaos Engineering

How to get started with Chaos Engineering!

1. **Understand Your System**
   Map out your system's architecture and dependencies. Identify potential failure points where things could go wrong.

2. **Form a Hypothesis**
   Predict how your system will respond to specific failures (e.g. a database outage, resource exhaustion, etc).

3. **Start Small**
   Choose a safe, non-production environment for your first experiments. Inject a controlled failure based on your hypothesis.

4. **Monitor and Analyze**
   Track how the system reacts to the simulated failure. Did it behave as expected? Did it recover gracefully?

5. **Learn and Adapt**
   Based on your findings, refine your system or create new experiments to test different failure scenarios.

Remember, chaos engineering is an ongoing process. The more you experiment, the better you'll understand and improve your system's resilience.
