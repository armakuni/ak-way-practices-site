# Automate your toil

Top tips!

**Define Clear Standards:**

Establish and document consistent coding guidelines that all developers must follow.

**Use Automated Tools:**

Implement linters and formatters to automatically check and enforce coding standards.

**Integrate with CI/CD:**

Integrate these tools into your continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline to ensure code is checked on every commit and pull request.

**Configure Commit Hooks:**

Set up commit hooks to run linters and formatters before code is committed, ensuring compliance early in the development process.
