# Stop the Line

Let's put it into practice!

- **Immediate Halt:** When a problem is detected, such as a failed test or build error, the pipeline stops all further actions.
- **Prioritize Fixes:** The teamâ€™s immediate focus shifts to diagnosing and fixing the issue to resume normal operations quickly.
- **Prevent Propagation:** By stopping the line, defects are contained and do not affect downstream processes or environments.
- **Quality Assurance:** This practice ensures that only stable and reliable code progresses through the pipeline, maintaining high standards of quality.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Implementing this principle requires robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect issues as soon as they arise.
