# Test Driven Development

The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is a fundamental process in Test-Driven Development (TDD) consisting of three steps:

**Red:**

- Write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add.
- Run the test and watch it fail. This step ensures that the test is valid and the functionality doesnâ€™t exist yet.

**Green:**

- Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
- Focus on getting the test to pass, not on perfecting the code.
- Run the test and see it pass.

**Refactor:**

- Refactor the code to improve its structure and readability without changing its behaviour.
- Ensure the code is clean and maintainable while keeping all tests passing.
- Run all tests to confirm that the refactored code still passes.

This cycle encourages incremental development, ensuring that each new feature is properly tested and integrated into the codebase.
