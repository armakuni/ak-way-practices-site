# Walking Skeleton

A walking skeleton is a stripped-down, minimal version of a system that showcases core functionality. It's essentially a bare-bones prototype that can actually run and demonstrate the basic idea. Here's how you can create one:

1. **Identify the Core Functionality:**
   - What's the absolute minimum set of features needed to prove the concept?
   - Focus on a single, crucial end-to-end process. Don't get bogged down in bells and whistles.
2. **Choose Your Building Blocks:**
   - Leverage existing code from past projects if possible.
   - Look for open-source libraries or templates that can provide a foundation.
   - You can also build from scratch, but prioritize efficiency here.
3. **Prioritize Functionality over Perfection:**
   - The goal is to get something working, not to craft a polished product.
   - Use stubs or mocks for non-essential components to keep things simple.
   - Focus on demonstrating the core logic and data flow.
4. **Keep it Running:**
   - Ensure the core functionality executes successfully, even if it's basic.
   - This is the "walking" part of the skeleton - it should function at a rudimentary level.
