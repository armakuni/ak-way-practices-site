# "Hello World" Pipeline

Deploying a simple "Hello World" application to production can be a great way to test your deployment pipeline and infrastructure. Here's a basic approach:

1. Create a "Hello World" Application:
   - This could be a simple script that prints "Hello World" to the console or a web application that returns the same message.
1. Set Up Version Control:
   - Use Git to create a repository for your code and track changes.
1. Configure Deployment:
   - Depending on your chosen technology, you'll need to set up a way to deploy your code to production. This might involve a simple script that copies files or a more complex configuration management tool.
1. Deploy:
   - Push your code to your version control system and trigger the deployment process.
1. Verify:
   - Once deployed, access your "Hello World" application (console or web interface) and confirm it displays the expected message.
