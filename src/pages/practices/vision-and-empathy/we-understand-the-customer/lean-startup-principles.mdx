# Lean Startup Principles

1. **Validated Learning:** Build products based on real customer feedback and data.
2. **Build-Measure-Learn:** Develop in short cycles, continuously measuring results and learning from them.
3. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** Create a basic version of the product to test assumptions and gather feedback quickly.
4. **Pivot or Persevere:** Use feedback to decide whether to make fundamental changes (pivot) or continue on the current path (persevere).
5. **Innovation Accounting:** Track progress using metrics that matter for startups, focusing on actionable, auditable, and accessible data.
