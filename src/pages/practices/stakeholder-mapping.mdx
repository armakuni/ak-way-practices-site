# Stakeholder Mapping

1. List all individuals and groups affected by or influencing the project.
2. Assess each stakeholder’s level of influence and interest in the project.
3. Place stakeholders on a power-interest grid with four quadrants: high power/high interest, high power/low interest, low power/high interest, low power/low interest.
4. Develop tailored strategies for engaging each category (e.g., keep high power/high interest stakeholders closely informed and involved, monitor low power/low interest stakeholders).
