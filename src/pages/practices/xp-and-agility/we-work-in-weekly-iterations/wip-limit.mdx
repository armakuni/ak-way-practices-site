# WIP Limit

The benefits of working on 1 thing at a time:

**Maximise focus:** By limiting the number of tasks, team members can concentrate fully on one item at a time, reducing context switching and improving efficiency.

**Identify bottlenecks:** If a single item is stuck, it becomes immediately apparent, allowing for quicker resolution.

**Reduce multitasking:** Encourages a single-tasking approach, often leading to better quality and faster delivery.

**Visualize workflow:** Makes it easier to see where work is piling up and where improvements can be made.
