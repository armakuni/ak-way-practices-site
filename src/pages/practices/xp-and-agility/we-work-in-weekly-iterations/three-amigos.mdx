# 3 Amigos

Prepping for your IPM can help make sure it's successful.

Try running a 3 amigos session!

**The Three Amigos** is a collaborative approach in Agile development where three key roles meet to discuss user stories:

**Product Owner:** Clarifies requirements.

**Developer:** Discusses feasibility and challenges.

**Tester:** Identifies edge cases and testability.

The Product Owner briefly presents the user storyâ€™s goal and context. Then together, ensure the acceptance criteria for the user stories for this iteration are clear, specific, and testable, so everyone knows that the story meets the "definition of done" and the "definition of ready" that the team agreed upon during the inception.
