# Sailboat retrospectives

Retros should be fun as much as they are productive.

**Here's how to run the sailboat retro:**

1. Draw a sailboat (team), island (goal), wind (helping), anchor (hindering), and rocks (risks).
1. Team members write down what helps (wind), hinders (anchor), and potential risks (rocks).
1. Review and group similar items, discussing key insights.
1. Prioritize and assign concrete actions to address hindrances and risks.
