# Pomodoro Pairing

A good way to get into a structure and rhythm is using the “Pomodoro Technique:”

1. Set a timer for 25min
1. Program till the timer is up
1. Put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
1. If there are less than 4 checkmarks take a 5 min break, otherwise take a 15–30 min break.
1. Erase your checkmarks
1. Jump back to step 1.

**Tips to help make it a successful session!**

1. **Embrace collaboration:** Pair programming is about working together, not just watching someone else code.
1. **Openness to feedback**: Be receptive to suggestions and critiques from your partner.
1. **Active listening:** Pay attention to what your partner is saying and doing.
