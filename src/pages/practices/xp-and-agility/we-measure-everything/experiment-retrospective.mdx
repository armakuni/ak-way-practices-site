# Experiment Retrospective

Make sure to have a retrospective after your experiment:

1. **Review Goals:** Revisit the experiment's purpose, scale, duration, and success criteria.
1. **Analyze Results:** Determine if the experiment met the success criteria and achieved the expected outcomes.
1. **Identify Learnings:** Reflect on insights gained, what worked, and what didnâ€™t.
1. **Apply Learnings:** Discuss how to adapt future efforts based on these insights.
