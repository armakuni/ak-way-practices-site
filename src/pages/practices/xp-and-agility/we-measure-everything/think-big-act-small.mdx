# Think Big, Act Small

**Think Big:** Envision the long-term impact, broader goals, or major innovations you want to achieve.

Leave out current user stories, feature requirements, one-off improvements, or things that would only benefit yourself.

**Act Small:** Break those goals into smaller, testable increments or experiments, delivering value step by step, allowing for feedback and continuous improvement.

We recommend something that can be done in a few sprints or within a couple of months.
