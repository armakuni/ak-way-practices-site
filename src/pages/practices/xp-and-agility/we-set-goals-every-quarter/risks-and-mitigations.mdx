# Risks & Mitigations

**Let's identify your risks and mitigations with this activity!**

As a team, use a board with a traffic light color system to categorize risks based on their likelihood and impact.

List all potential risks to the project, and discuss any that need clarification.

Begin a voting session, where you can allocate multiple votes to a single risk if you believe it's particularly significant.

For the top three risks, collaboratively add mitigation strategies in the right-hand column.
