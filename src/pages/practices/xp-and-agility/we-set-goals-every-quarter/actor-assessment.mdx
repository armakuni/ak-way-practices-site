# Actors Assessment

**Try this activity to help identify your actors:**

Add individuals, teams, and organisations who are customers of what you are creating to a board.

Group the actors when they will have the same expectation or deliverable from your team

Refine the actors to less than 10 in total.

The actors will be the subjects of your User Stories, so make sure you have an appropriate range
