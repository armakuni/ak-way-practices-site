# The 5 whys

Figuring out the "why" of a user story involves understanding the deeper purpose or value behind the feature or task. Hereâ€™s one way to uncover it:

The 5 Whys Technique

- Ask "Why" Multiple Times
  Keep asking "Why?" to drill down into the root cause or purpose behind the request. This helps move beyond surface-level features and get to the core value.
- _Example:_
  1.  Why does the user need this feature?
      To save time.
  2.  Why is saving time important?
      Because they have a busy schedule.
  3.  Why does having a busy schedule matter?
      Because they need to maximize efficiency.
- This line of questioning helps reveal the true motivation behind the request.
