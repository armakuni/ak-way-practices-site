# "Rightsizing" User Stories

**To create effective User Stories that can be completed in half a day, focus on:**

**Clarity and focus:** Each story should have a single objective with clear acceptance criteria.

**Small and independent:** Break down larger features into smaller, self-contained stories.

**Value delivery:** Ensure each story provides value, even if it's small.

**Collaboration:** Work with the team to identify natural breakpoints and refine stories.

**Continuous improvement:** Regularly review story size and adjust your approach as needed.
