# Acceptance criteria

Acceptance criteria are the specific conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete. They bridge the gap between the abstract user story and the concrete implementation.

**Good acceptance criteria should be:**

**Clear and concise:** Easily understood by everyone involved.

**Testable:** Can be verified with specific test cases.

**Specific:** Clearly define the desired outcome.

**Independent:** Each criterion should stand alone.

**Measurable:** The results can be objectively assessed
