# INVEST Criteria

When writing a User Story, keep the INVEST criteria in mind:

**Independent:** The story can be developed and delivered on its own, without dependencies.

**Negotiable:** The story is open to discussion and refinement, not a rigid contract.

**Valuable:** The story provides clear value to the user or customer.

**Estimable:** The story is defined enough to estimate the effort required.

**Small:** The story is manageable and can be completed within an iteration.

**Testable:** The story has clear acceptance criteria, making it easy to verify completion.
