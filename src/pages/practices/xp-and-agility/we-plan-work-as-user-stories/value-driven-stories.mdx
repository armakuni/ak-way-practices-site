# Value-Driven User Stories

Writing a value-driven user story focuses on the tangible benefits to the user, ensuring clear customer value and aligning development with the productâ€™s overall goals.

**Instead of:** _As a user, I want to see a list of products._

**Try:** _As a customer interested in purchasing electronics, I want to easily find products that match my needs and budget, so I can make an informed purchase._

**Checklist for Writing Value-Driven User Stories:**

1. Does the story focus on a specific user role or persona?
1. Is the feature described in a clear and understandable way?
1. Does the story explain the tangible benefit or value to the user?
1. Is the value something that can be measured or validated after implementation?
1. Does the story align with broader business objectives?
