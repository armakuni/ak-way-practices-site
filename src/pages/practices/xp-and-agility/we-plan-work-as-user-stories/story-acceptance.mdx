# Story acceptance

To get user stories accepted into the "Completed" state:

**Align** with product vision and understand the product roadmap.

**Communicate** clearly and concisely and leverage clear conditions for completion via acceptance criteria.

**Build Strong Relationships** seek feedback and gain insights into their priorities and challenges.

**Data Driven Approach** data to support your ideas, track and measure, ROI analysis, etc.

**Effective Collaborate** closely with the product manager, be open to change, and ensure the team understands the story and goals
