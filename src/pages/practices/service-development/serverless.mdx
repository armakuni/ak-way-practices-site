## What is Serverless?

Serverless is anything which uses per utilisation billing, which typically includes:

* Bandwidth Used
* Storage Used
* Requests Received

It is also closely related to products which offer Functions as a Service (FaaS), such as [Amazon Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) as they, and the services supporting them, are typically billed this way.

Functions as a Service are small bits of code that are executed based on various events, such as a user making a web request, or a message arriving in a queue. They came to exist as they allow the by request billing, which isn't as possible with traditional Virtual Machines (VMs).

There is also a framework called [Serverless](https://serverless.com/), which aims to simplify and unify the deployment of applications developed using FaaS.

## Why use Serverless

Serverless is still an immature technology, meaning there are some gains as well as pains when trying to use it.

### Gains

There are a few main benefits of using Serverless Technologies

* You pay per request, meaning no wasted capacity
* No more server or network maintenance, freeing up time to be spent on value-producing work
* Scaling up and down is managed by your hosting provider

### Pains

Having said this, Serverless does have some downsides

* Each vendor has a different implementation, meaning you could become locked in
* May require a significant change to your codebase. You might need to spend a lot to change your application to run on a Serverless architecture
* Harder to secure, as everything is running on someone else's system and how to protect your data and network is relatively undeveloped.
* You can't deploy your own and still get the benefits, meaning you have to use a hosted solution
* Due to the pricing models used request, or memory heavy applications can become expensive fast
