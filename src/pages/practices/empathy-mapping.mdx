# Empathy Mapping

1. Gather your team and necessary materials (e.g., a large paper or whiteboard, sticky notes).
2. Create four quadrants labeled: “Says,” “Thinks,” “Does,” and “Feels.”
3. Conduct user research or interviews to gather insights.
4. Populate each quadrant with observations and quotes from users, reflecting their thoughts, feelings, actions, and spoken words.
5. Discuss findings to identify patterns and insights for improving user experience.
