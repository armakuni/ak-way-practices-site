# Cognitive Load Workshop

There are 3 types of cognitive load:

**Intrinsic, The Base Effort:** Understanding the inherent complexity of the material or task itself.

**Extraneous, The Environment:** The way information is presented and by activities that do not directly contribute to learning.

**Germaine, Area of Special Focus:** Processing, constructing, and automating schemas to facilitate learning and understanding.

1. Write down the tasks you do day-to-day. Remember to include your learning to do things.
2. Sort them into Intrinsic, Extraneous, and Germaine.
3. Write down ideas to:
   * Simplify and automate intrinsic tasks.
   * Minimize extraneous load. Reduce the noise and distractions from your environment.
   * Maximize the germane load. Explore, innovate, and create.
