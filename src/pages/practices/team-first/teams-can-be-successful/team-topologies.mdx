# Team Topologies - Team Types

**Stream-aligned Team:** Aligned to a continuous flow of work from a specific business domain or customer need, focusing on delivering valuable outcomes directly to customers.

**Enabling Team:** Helps stream-aligned teams to overcome obstacles, adopt new skills or technologies, and increase their autonomy.

**Complicated-Subsystem Team:** Responsible for building and maintaining parts of the system that require specialized knowledge and expertise, often due to their complexity or criticality.

**Platform Team:** Provides internal services to streamline and support the work of stream-aligned teams, aiming to reduce their cognitive load by offering self-service capabilities and reusable components.

1. Take a look at the different kinds of teams in Team Topologies.
1. You may want to think about what type of team you are. Are you a Platform team, an Enabling team, or a Stream-aligned team?
1. How do you want your team to interact with others which provide you with data necessary to complete your tasks? Should they be operating in X-as-a-Service or Facilitation mode? Can you discuss the positioning of your team with respect to others with your stakeholders?
1. Are there existing patterns which articulate how your team could interact with others?
