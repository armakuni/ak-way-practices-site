# Trunk Based Development Practice

1. **Main Branch Focus:** Development happens on the main branch, not long-lived feature branches.
1. **Frequent & Small Commits:** Push small, incremental changes regularly to the main branch.
1. **Automation is Key:** Automated tests run on every commit (CI) to ensure quality.
1. **Pull Requests (Optional):** Can be used for code review before merging to the main branch.
1. **Always Deployable:** The main branch should always be ready for deployment.

**Benefits:**

- Faster integration and deployments.
- Less merge conflicts.
- Improved code stability.
- Better team visibility into the codebase.
