# The Boy Scout Rule

The **Boy Scout Rule** can help developers avoid technical debt by making small, consistent improvements over time.

This rule can be applied in many ways.

Look for opportunities to refactor existing code to make it cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain such as:

- Renaming a variable
- Removing duplication
- Breaking up a long function
- Refactoring
- Improving documentation
- Optimizing a segment
