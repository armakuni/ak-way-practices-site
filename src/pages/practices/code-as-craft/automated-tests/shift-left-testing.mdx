# Shift-Left Testing Techniques

**Unit Testing:** Writing unit tests that verify the functionality of individual units of code (functions, classes).

**Integration Testing:** Testing how different modules or components of the system work together.

**API Testing:** Testing the functionality and behavior of APIs used by your application.

**Static Code Analysis:** Utilizing tools to analyze code for potential issues like syntax errors, security vulnerabilities, and coding best practices violations.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Writing tests before writing the actual code for a feature. This forces developers to think about the functionality from a testable perspective.
