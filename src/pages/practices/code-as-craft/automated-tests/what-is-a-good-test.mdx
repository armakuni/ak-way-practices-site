# What's a good test?

**A good test should be several things:**

- **Clear and concise:** It should be easy to understand what the test is trying to achieve.
- **Atomic:** It should test one specific piece of functionality or behavior.
- **Independent:** The outcome of the test shouldn't rely on other tests passing or failing.
- **Repeatable:** It should produce the same results consistently when run multiple times.
- **Measurable:** It should have a clear pass/fail criteria based on a desired outcome.
- **Relevant:** It should test something valuable to the overall quality of the software.
