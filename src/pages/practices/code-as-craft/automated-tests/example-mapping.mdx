# Example Mapping

**How to run an Example Mapping Workshop:**

1. **User Story Takes the Spotlight:**
   Clearly write the user story on a central sticky note (physical or digital).

2. **Break Down the Rules:**
   Use separate notes/sections for each acceptance criteria (rules) defining the user story.

3. **Examples Breathe Life into Rules:**
   For each rule, add specific examples illustrating how it works (multiple examples per rule are okay).

4. **Questions? Don't Sweat It!**
   Capture any questions or confusions on separate notes/sections to address later.

5. **Discuss, Refine, and Collaborate:**
   Talk through the examples, ensuring everyone understands the user story and how the rules apply.

6. **Make it Shine!**
   Refine the story, rules, and examples based on the discussion.
