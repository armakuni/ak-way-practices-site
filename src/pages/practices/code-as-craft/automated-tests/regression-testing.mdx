# Regression Testing

**Top tips for regression testing**

**Test Incrementally:** Test new features or changes alongside their corresponding regression tests. This helps pinpoint the root cause of regressions more quickly.

**Go Beyond Functionality:** Consider non-functional aspects like performance, usability, and security during regression testing.

**Explore Different Devices and Browsers:** Test your software on a variety of devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and catch regressions specific to certain environments.

**Document Everything:** Record test results, including successes, failures, and any observed regressions. This documentation helps track progress and identify trends.
