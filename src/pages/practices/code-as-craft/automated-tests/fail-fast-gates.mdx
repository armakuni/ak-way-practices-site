# Fail-Fast Gates

**Flag trouble spots:** Identify crucial development phases where bugs are expensive.

**Set the bar:** Define clear criteria (test failures, code coverage) for each checkpoint.

**Automate checks:** Use CI tools to run tests and analysis automatically at these points.

**Fix fast, move on:** Address issues immediately upon a failed gate.

**Learn and adapt:** Monitor and refine your fail-fast gates for optimal workflow.

By implementing these steps, you can create a development environment where issues are identified and addressed promptly.
