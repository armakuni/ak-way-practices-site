# Pair Programming Practical Examples

1. **Driver/Navigator**
   Most common style. One person (driver) writes the code, while the other (navigator) reviews, suggests improvements, and keeps an eye on the bigger picture.

   Used when: General-purpose pairing, learning new codebases, debugging

2. **Ping-Pong**
   Rapid switching between driver and navigator roles potentially e.g. after a test pass.

   Used when: Keeps both programmers engaged and fosters active discussion.

3. Unstructured
   No predefined roles. Both programmers discuss, design, and code collaboratively in a free-flowing way. Works well for experienced programmers.

   Used when: Experienced engineers collaborating and experimenting with differing approaches

4. Tour Guide
   One programmer (usually senior) guides a less experienced programmer through the code, explaining thought processes and best practices.

   Used when: mentoring, onboarding, knowledge transfer
