The idea is

1. **Empathise** with the the people experiencing the problem, and understand them and their needs.
1. Combine your research and **define** the core problem
1. Generate some **ideas** on how to solve that problem
1. **Prototype** that some variations on that idea
1. **Test** and feedback which prototypes have worked

### Empathise

Conduct research to develop an understanding of your users. After this step you should have more ideas of things you could do.

- Service Blueprints [[Practical Service Design](http://www.practicalservicedesign.com/download-the-guide/)] [[Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/service-blueprints-definition/)]

### Define

Combine your research and observe where your users problems exist. After this step you should have closed in on the problem you're going to solve.

### Ideate

Generate a range of crazy, creative ideas. After this step you should have more of a range of options of things you could build.

- Mind Maps [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map)]
- Product Canvas [[Roman Plicher](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-canvas/)]

### Prototype

Build real tactile representations of your ideas. After this step you should have a real tactile thing you can test.

- _See everything under "[Technology Tools](../technology-tools/index.md)" and "[Service Development](../service-development/index.md)"_

### Test

Return to your users for feedback. After this step you should have an idea if your prototype solved the problem or not.
