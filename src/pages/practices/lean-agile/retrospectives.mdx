# Retrospectives

At the end of an iteration, we go through a retrospective meeting, where we
discuss all the things that went good and didn't and we make suggestions for
improvement.

## Running a Weekly Retrospective

During an Ak engagement, we hold a retrospective meeting at the end of every
iteration (typically every week). An Ak retrospective should have three steps.

These retrospectives typically take **1 hour**.

### Step 1: Check previous actions

To start the session, we walk through each of the outstanding actions from
previous retrospectives and check the progress. The aim of this step is to
ensure that actions are being acted on.

### Step 2: Check the goals

!!! warning "Currently being trialed"
    This step has been added as a reaction to repeated experiences in goals
    changing during Ak engagements. This is currently an experiment and if you
    are trying it, then please feed your experiences back to the company.

In this step we ask three questions (ideally with the inception goals on display):

1. _How much work have we done which directly contributes to the goals?_
     - Good answer is _"a lot"_, bad answer is _"none"_.
     - If the answer is low, we need to understand why and work out how to fix this problem.
2. _Have we done any work which is primarily focussed on delivering a non-goal?_
     - Good answer is _"no"_, bad answer is _"yes, all work has been for a non-goal"_.
     - If the team has been working on non-goals then we need to understand why.
     - If the Product Owner has been pressing for work on non-goals, then we need to dissuade them or re-evaluate the goals.
3. _How much work have we done which does not directly contribute to a goal or non-goal?_
     - Good answer is _"none"_, bad answer is _"a lot"_
     - If a lot of work has been done on things which don't directly contribute to the goals or non-goals, the we need to ask the following questions:
          1. _Why?_
          2. _Is there a missing goal/non-goal?_
          3. _Do we need to re-incept/cancel this engagement?_

### Step 3: The retrospective activity

There are [many different retrospective formats](http://www.funretrospectives.com/)
which the facilitator can choose from. However, the _What went well,
What I'm thinking about, What could be improved_ format is the Ak favourite.

!!! info "What went well, To discuss, What didn't go well"
    In this format, four columns are created they are labelled
    **What went well**, **What I'm thinking about**, **What could be improved**
    and **Actions**. Alternatively, faces are drawn for the first three
    (i.e üôÇ üòê üôÅ).

    Everyone then silently populates the first three columns.

    The faciliator then picks each item and invites the author to start a
    short discussion. During this discussion, any actions to be performed as a
    result are captured in the **Actions** column and assigned to someone.
