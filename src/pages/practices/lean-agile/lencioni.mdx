# Lencioni model

The Lencioni model is a model for team dynamics created by Patrick Lencioni and explained in his book `The 5 dysfunctions of a team` originally published in 2002.

## How Does It Work?

The model is relatively simple, and just creates 5 layers (usually represented in pyramidal format) that represent 5 different qualities on a team. The five elements are: Trust, Conflict, Commitment, Accountability and Results. Lencioni then describes the 5 dysfunctions of a team as negative versions of those 5 qualities: Absence of Trust, Fear of Conflict, Lack of Commitment, Avoidance of Accountability and Inattention to Results.

Solving those 5 dysfunctions helps in creating a great team.
