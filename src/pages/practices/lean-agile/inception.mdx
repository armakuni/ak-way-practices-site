# Inception

An inception meeting is used to set the goals for a time-boxed piece of work. We
typically choose periods of around **three months** (which aligns with eXtreme
Programming's Quarterly Cycles), however, this can be adjusted based on the
circumstances.

## Running an Inception Meeting

To run an inception, you need to make sure you have the following:

- **The right people**: It's important to have the right people in the room for
  an inception; missing key people can result in the wrong or unobtainable goals
  being defined.
- **Enough time**: Typically an inception meeting takes about **one day** but a
  large story mapping session can easily take it into a second day.
- **Space**: For an inception, you want a room where you won't be disturbed and
  has suitable wall space and/or whiteboards.
- **Resources**:
  - Sharpies
  - Plenty of Post It notes
  - Refreshments and snacks

### 1. Goals and Non-goals

For the first activity, we start defining the **goals** and **non-goals**
(also known as _anti-goals_).

This is done collaboratively and can be done using Post It notes, index cards,
a whiteboard, or in a digital document. Whatever medium you choose, it should
be one where you're free to move items around.

#### Goals

Goals are things that we want to achieve by the end of the time we are holding
an inception for. For a goal to be in the list it should be achievable and
measurable (i.e. we have to be able to know when we have completed it).

Examples of good goals might be:

- Fully automated deployments
- Add the product review feature
- Get 1000 new users

Examples of bad goals might be:

- Improve the quality of the code _(how do we know we have done it?)_
- Fly to Pluto _(unobtainable feature)_

#### Non-goals (or anti-goals)

Non-goals are things that we don't want to work on in this iteration. They may
be things that we want to do in the future but we are explicitly identify them
as things that we don't want to do right now.

The idea with non-goals is to remove the focus from things which might distract
us in delivering the goals. It is important to try and capture all possible
non-goals.

### 2. Risks

Now we have a set of goals, we want to identify the risks which might jeopardize
the team's ability to complete the goals.

We often do this silently, each writing down our own risks on PostIt notes. Once
everyone has finished, we

1. present them
2. group them
3. dot vote them (place a dot
   on the groups you feel are the biggest risk - _limited to three dots each_)
4. discuss them

The goal of the discussion is to try and find ways to mitigate each risk.
Mitigations might include things like:

- Having a meeting
- Spiking an unknown early on
- Adding a non-goal (or moving a goal to a non-goal)

### 3. Actors

Next we start looking at all the people involved in delivering the goals. The
aim here is to identify who is required to achieve the goals and make sure that
the team have appropriate access to these people.

### 4. Story Mapping

Once we believe we have reachable goals, we then start to build a backlog of
work. The primary technique for this is User Story Mapping. User Story Mapping
is a big topic in its own right, therefore, you can find a whole page dedicated
to it [here](./user-story-mapping.md).

### 5. Estimation

Finally, the stories are estimated. We usually do this using _story points_
on a _Fibonnaci scale_. That is to say, we estimate the work of a story
relative to the estimated work of other stories. The simplest stories are
estimated as 1 point, with other stories being estimated as 2x, 3x, 5x or 8x the
effort.

Estimates are often done with a round of

## Facilitation Tips

### Take regular breaks

Inception meetings are long and intense so you need to make sure that you take
enough breaks to not tire people out.

### Ensure people are engaged

Inceptions require the attention of the people present, ideally you want to
ensure people are focussed on the task rather than looking at phones or laptops.

### Refreshments

Make sure there's some refreshments in the room to keep everyone's energy levels
up.

## Next Steps

### 1. Migrate all the stories into Pivotal Tracker

Pivotal Tracker is our project tracking tool of choice (obviously, if the client
is using something else then use that instead). Once the inception is over, all
the stories and estimations should be transferred to the tracker.

You can find more details on how we use Pivotal Tracker [here](https://theway.armakuni.co.uk/technology-tools/pivotal-tracker/).

### 2. Delivering goals, rejecting non-goals

Start work on the project, working in small iterations (typically 1 week).

Use the goals and non-goals as a reference when doing iteration planning and
retrospectives to ensure that the team is still on target.

If the work starts to deviate from the goals, or new goals start being defined,
then this should be raised and a decision on how to continue the engagement
should be discussed.
