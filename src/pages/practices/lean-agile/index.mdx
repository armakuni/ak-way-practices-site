# Lean Agile

- [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
- [Agile vs Lean Agile](https://hackerchick.com/agile-vs-lean-yeah-yeah-whats-the-difference/)

Our preferred Agile process is [XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming).

Our opinionated view on XP makes use of the following:

## Pre-Inception and Product Discovery

Pre-Inception is a meeting between the client and the Ak engagement lead to understand if the client knows enough about what they want to do, where they think they want to get to, whether they have the resources for running the project the way they think they want to (they have a room, they have pairing stations, etc.). It facilitates Product Discovery. It's kind of a reality check that gives us an idea if it's even worth having an inception.

## Inception

We like starting a new project with an inception meeting, same as what you might know as a kick-off meeting from a Scrum/Kanban process.

For details on running an inception, see the [Inception](./inception.md) page.

## Product Ownership

A Product Owner is a person who works on the client side that represents the clients feedback and input to the team. They are involved on daily basis with the team; they are responsible for prioritising the backlog and accepting/rejecting the delivered tickets.

## Working Agreements

These contain the Definition of Ready, Definition of Done.

- _**Definition of Ready**_: When a story has all the prerequisites to be worked on by a team. Our approach to this is having a short description of the intention of the current story (`As a X I want to do Y so that I can achieve Z.`), followed by an _Acceptance Criteria_ defined as a GWT (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN) scenario (Gherkin style).
- _**Definition of Done**_: Criteria that is added to the description of a story so that Product Owners know how to check that it is completed.

## Iterative Development

We facilitate iterative development via iterations. You can see iterations as Sprints to some extent. Our iterations are not longer than 1 week though, as opposed to Sprints that use a fixed iteration period at least 2 weeks long most of the times. We don't wait until the iteration ends to demo what we've done, as it's the case with Sprints; we do continuous deployment of features/functionality, thus allowing us to receive quicker feedback from customers.

An iteration typically starts with an [Iteration Planning Meeting](./iteration-planning-meeting.md)
and ends with a [Retrospective](./retrospectives.md).

## Making Work Visible

Making work visible helps you eliminate your bottlenecks in order to achieve a lean process. There are different techniques for this; you can learn about these in the book linked below, which we also have in the office as a paperback.

## Retrospectives

At the end of an iteration, we go through a retrospective meeting, where we discuss all the things that went good and didn't and we make suggestions for improvement.

For more details on running retrospectives are Ak, see [Retrospectives](./retrospectives.md).
